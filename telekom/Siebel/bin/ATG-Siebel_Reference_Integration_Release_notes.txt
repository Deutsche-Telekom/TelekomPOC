OVERVIEW
------------

Fulfillment Server improvements:

The Fulfillment Server can now scale horizantally by enabling multiple instances to run. (see the components /atg/dynamo/messaging/*). This uses ATG's patchbay SqlJms implementation. Please see the appropriate documentation with regard to tuning this:

In addition, a multi threaded Order Submitter was added. This keeps the amount of processing logic occuring in the Fulfillment server to an absolute minimum, and uses a stored procedure to update the order state in the database, rather than going through ATG's repository API. As such, the following stored procesure must be added to the database:
